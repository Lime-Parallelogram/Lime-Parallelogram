Welcome, I am a computing enthusiast studing for A-Levels. I am studying **mathematics, computer science, physics and further mathematics** here in the UK at VI Form. I'm working hard to achieve highly on my A-Levels and also to develop my super-curricluar computing & programming knowledge.

## 🔭 Current Projects
### Pirate Game - 🏴‍☠️
> **Language -** _Python, Web (HTML,CSS,JS)_   
**Project Length -** _6 months_  
>
> **Overview -** In an effort to gain experience in collaborative development, this project is an attempt to remaster one of our favourie pen-and-paper games from school maths lessons. Pirate Game Live is a flask-based online application. The game is largely luck-based and works by at inviting users to place items in a grid. A random grid sqaure is selected and the user must use the items in those squares against other users. For example, the user chooses a target for their 'steal' and they take over the target's money.  
>
> **Learning -** This project has been an amazing opportunity to not only learn more about flask and improve my knowledge of webpage and web-languages but also to develop my knowledge of deploying software and websites to the internet using a VPS. The largest learning curve came with working with the live communication. This was achived using websockets which allow each of the clients to play live games with other players in their game.

### open-DPS - 🔌
> **Language -** _Python_   
> **Overview -** After building a variable output power supply to aid with my electronics projects, I decided to investigate the included bluetooth caperbillities. Disatisfied with the manufacture's software offering, I went in search of an open-source alternative and found [this repo](https://github.com/Haschtl/PyDPS). Unfortunately the provided UI was also not to my taste and the bluetooth implementation relies upon the now deprecated `rfcomm` command. This project aims to satisfy all of my needs for such an application and provide a base for others to develop from.  
> **Learning -** This has tought me a great deal about creating GUIs using PyQT and using the QTDesigner to simplify this process. In the abscence of any pre-built libraries for such a specialist application, this is also an amazing opportunity to learn more about the low-level bluetooth communication protocols that are in use in setup like this. 

### pyIR - 🎛️
> **Language -** _Python_  
> **Overview -** Stemming from a YouTube video I made a few years back, I am working on a python library that can be used in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi an an IR Receiver in order to identify which buttons have been pressed on an infrared remote.  
> **Learning -** I have learned a lot about making a module that other people could use. I have also learned about hardware protcols that are used by different types of IR Remotes.

### octoClock - 🕘
> **Language -** _Python_  
> **Overview -** The OctoClock is another hardware project that I have been working on developing software for. It uses a Raspberry Pi and addressable LEDs to display, on the face of a wall clock, the remaining time of print jobs on my 3D Printer.  
> **Learning -** I have learned a great deal about making versatile software and interacting with APIs such as the OctoPrint API.  

## 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Future Collaboration
I am hoping that I can contribute to the _paperless_ project in order to add some of my own ideas to this amazing peice of software that I use to keep my school work filed in an orderly manor.
