Welcome, I am a computing enthusiast studing for A-Levels. I am studying **mathematics, computer science, physics and further mathematics** here in the UK at VI Form. I'm working hard to achieve highly on my A-Levels and also to develop my super-curricluar computing & programming knowledge.

## 🔭 Current Projects
### Pirate Game - 🏴‍☠️
> **Language -** _Python, Web (HTML,CSS,JS)_   
**Project Length -** _6 months_  
>
> **Overview -** In an effort to gain experience in collaborative development, this project is an attempt to remaster one of our favourie pen-and-paper games from school maths lessons. Pirate Game Live is a flask-based online game. The game is largely luck-based game that invites users to place items in a grid. A random grid sqaure is selected and the users can use the items in those squares against other users. For example, the user chooses a target for their 'steal' and they take over the target's money.  
>
> **Learning -** This project has been an amazing opportunity to not only learn more about flask and improve my knowledge of webpage and web-languages but also to develop my knowledge of deploying software and websites to the internet using a VPS. The largest learning curve came with working with the live communication. This was achived using websockets which allow each of the clients to play live games with other players in their game.
